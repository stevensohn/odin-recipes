                <li>Heat up a 3 cup earthenware pot (ttukbaegi) on the stove over medium high heat for about 3 to 4 minutes. If you use a small heavy pan or pot, it will take less.</li>

                <li>Add the pork. Stir for 3 minutes until the pork is no longer pink.</li>
                <li>Add kimchi and keep stirring for a minute. Add ½ cup anchovy stock. Cover and cook for 7 minutes over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add the salt and the sugar and mix well.</li>
                <li>Cut the tube of soft tofu into half and squeeze it out into the pot. Gently break up the tofu with a wooden spoon. If you want, add a few tablespoons of stock.</li>
                <li>Put the hot pepper mixture on top and spread it with the spoon.</li>
                <li>Crack the egg and put it on top, in the center of the stew. Let it bubble and sizzle for 1 minute.</li>
